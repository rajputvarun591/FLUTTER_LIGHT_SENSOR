# Flutter Light Sensor Package 

This is a package made with Flutter and Android to fetch the Data from Light Sensor of the device. 
Althrough I am looking for a contributor for the IOS side. I have already completed this for Android Side.

## Features
#### 1. Fetch Light Sensor data by Stream From the Device Natively.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.
